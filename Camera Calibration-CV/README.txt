Hello Professor

I have initially written a function that accepts the 3d world cordinates to output 2d image cordinates, but in order to print them, 
I have changed it to a .m file that just prints out the intrinsic and extrinsic values. Its in the folder named 1.Camera Calibration

The required result 3, i.e. plotting the codrinates onto the image is in the folder 2.Part3 Result

In the folder 3.Video Source Code, all the scripts required for generating videos are present along with their videos with the same file name.

I had a really good time in designing the animation schemes for the video as it required me to think in a new way.

Hope I did not cause any confusion by explaining where the outputs are.

Thanking You
